## 📚 About

This repository is a collection of my work as I go through various JavaScript tutorials, challenges, and exercises. It's designed to help solidify my understanding of JavaScript concepts, such as data types, loops, functions, object-oriented programming (OOP), and more!

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- **Master core JavaScript concepts**: Variables, functions, loops, data types, and DOM manipulation.
- **Understand advanced JavaScript**: Closures, promises, async/await, and ES6+ features.
- **Build real-world projects**: Applications and tools to practice and improve my skills.
- **Get familiar with JavaScript frameworks**: React, Node.js, and more.

## 💻 Projects

Here are the projects I would worked on or plan to work on as part of my JavaScript learning journey:

1. **[JavaScript Calculator](#)**  
   - A basic calculator built using vanilla JavaScript that handles arithmetic operations.

2. **[To-Do List App](#)**  
   - A simple to-do list application that allows adding, editing, and deleting tasks, with persistent storage using localStorage.

3. **[Weather App](#)**  
   - A weather app that fetches data from an external API to display current weather details based on the user's location.

4. **[JavaScript Quiz App](#)**  
   - A quiz app that tests JavaScript knowledge with multiple-choice questions.

5. **[Portfolio Website](#)**  
   - A personal portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and resume.
